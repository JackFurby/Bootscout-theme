## Development help

### Compile scss to css

From root of project run `gulp css` and `gulp editor-css`. This will update editor.css, editor.css.map, b4st.css and b4st.css.map files.

Basic setup info for scss here (not my guide): https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st/wiki/Customizing-Bootstrap-4-(SCSS)-in-b4st
